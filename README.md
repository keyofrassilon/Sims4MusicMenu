# Sims4MusicMenu
Music editing and playlist import for Sims 4

Code is a bit of a mess but works currently. I need to write up a proper help but you can get more help in the mod itself by selecting help from the menu. To get started go to builkd mode and search for Retro. There is a Boombox with several swatches you can use that work with this menu. You then select Menu when clicking on the Boombox.
