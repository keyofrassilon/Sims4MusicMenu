# Sims4MusicMenu
Music editing and playlist import for Sims 4

Code is a bit of a mess but works currently. I need to write up a proper help but you can get more help in the mod itself by selecting help from the menu. To get started go to build mode and search for Retro. There is a Boombox with several swatches you can use that work with this menu. You then select Menu when clicking on the Boombox. You can create playlists either in this menu or in a program like foobar2000. Save all playlists in foobar2000 as m3u8 to the Playlists folder under Scripts. Code is currently raw and uncompiled. WIll be compiled when it goes out of Beta.
