Music Menu Documentation

Note on playlists. All playlists are saved using the m3u standard and use UTF-8 encoding, so when saving a playlist in
an external program like foobar2000, make sure to save using the m3u8 format.

[Change Music Directory] is a bit tricky at first. It selects a folder to use for a selected genre.

Try using this method:

Select [Playlist Options] > [Default Music Directory] > [Menu] > [Cancel] > Bring the menu back up >
[Change Music Directory] > Select a folder > [Use This Directory] > Select a genre and done

[Default Music Directory] is where you keep your default music. Currently tied to your Music folder under your
windows profile. You can browse using the [Custom Music Directory] or from your current location selecting [Back] or
[Up One Directory]. You can also click on folder names without the mp3 extension. Clicking on a file with the mp3
extension will append that file to the temp playlist in memory.

[Custom Music Directory] is stored in music.dat. It can be any directory on your computer.

All playlists are loaded and stored in memory until you save or build them.
